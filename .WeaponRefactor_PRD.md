# Refactor Weapon System with WeaponManager

## Feature Title:
**Refactor Weapon System with WeaponManager**

---

## User Story:
_As a player, I want to unlock and upgrade additional weapons (including drone-based firepower), so I can expand my offensive capabilities and customize my attack style during gameplay._

---

## Tasks Breakdown:
| Key         | Summary                                               | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| GJG2-104    | Modify existing weapon code for new impl.              | Refactor all firing logic out of `Player.js`. Existing bullet spawn and input handling should be rerouted to `WeaponManager.js`. |
| GJG2-105    | Create class to handle multiple weapons                | `WeaponManager` should manage an array of weapon "slots" (Player + 1–5 drones). Each slot may share a weapon type and be upgradeable. |
| GJG2-106    | Ensure weapon logic is handled independently of Player | `WeaponManager` must be decoupled from Player state logic. It will respond to commands (e.g., fire, upgrade) but run its own logic loop and sprite rendering if needed. |
| GJG2-107    | Test weapons                                           | Validate firing logic, drone weapon sync, upgrade handling, and sprite switching between weapon types. |

## System Behavior

### WeaponManager
- Central authority for:
  - Firing logic
  - Cooldowns and fire rate
  - Weapon upgrades
  - Drone weapon mirroring
  - Sprite swaps based on weapon type

```js
class WeaponManager {
  constructor(scene, playerRef) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.player = playerRef;
    this.weaponType = 'basic';
    this.drones = [];
  }

  fire() {
    this.spawnBullet(this.player.x, this.player.y);
    this.drones.forEach(drone => drone.fire());
  }

  upgradeWeapon(newType) {
    this.weaponType = newType;
    this.updateSprites();
  }

  updateSprites() {
    // Change gun visuals for player + all drones
  }

  spawnBullet(x, y) {
    // Phaser bullet logic
  }
}
```

---

## Drones (1–5 max)
- Float in orbit around the player (circular pattern or set offsets).
- Inherit `weaponType`, fire on the same cooldown.
- Use same projectile logic.
- Individual drone entities should be modular (can add/remove at runtime).
- Use `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite` or `Container`.

---

## Visual Requirements
- Player gun sprite must update when weapon is upgraded.
- Drone sprites must also reflect the currently selected gun type.
- WeaponManager must switch sprites dynamically.

---

## Assets
- Minimum of 2 weapon types.
- Bullet graphics tied to weapon type.
- Drone gun sprites should match the player’s gun sprite when upgraded.

---

## Test Scenarios
| Scenario | Expected Outcome |
|---------|------------------|
| Player fires gun | Bullet spawns from player with correct sprite |
| Player buys a drone | Drone orbits and fires in sync |
| Weapon is upgraded | Both player and all drones update gun sprite and fire new bullet type |
| WeaponManager is initialized | No logic left in `Player.js` beyond delegating fire input |

---

## Integration Notes
- Integrate with `Player.js` via a minimal interface: `weaponManager.fire()` inside player input code.
- Use `Scene.add.existing()` if WeaponManager/drones render game objects.
- Drone creation logic can optionally live in `WeaponManager` or a separate `DroneManager` if complexity grows.
